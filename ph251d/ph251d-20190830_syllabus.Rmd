# Course Description

## Prerequisites

- Prior courses: introductory courses in epidemiology and
  Biostatistics
- Prior experience: basic epidemiologic programming (e.g., Stata, SAS) 
- Motivation: relentless commitment to invest time coding in R


## Overview of course

This is an intensive one-semester introduction to the R programming
language for applied epidemiology from a population health data
science perspective.  **Population health** is "a systems framework
for studying and improving the health of populations through
collective action and learning"
[@Aragon2019_escholarship.org-uc-item-9xg5t30s].  Populations include
clinical and community populations (neighborhoods, social networks).
**Population health data science** (PHDS) is ``the art and science of
transforming data into information and actionable knowledge that
informs, influences or optimizes decisions[^dq] to protect and improve
the health and well-being of populations.''

[^dq]: A *decision* is an irrevocable commitment of time or resources towards achieving an objective.  In public health, and in life, decision making is our single, most important activity.  Every decision has an opportunity cost---the loss benefit of the better option not chosen or not considered.  ``Decisions determine destiny'' (Frederick Speakman).


PHDS rests on the foundation of **population health thinking** (PHT)
[@Aragon2018_PopHealthThinking]---a problem-solving, inferential
framework that uses Bayesian networks for

1. probabilistic reasoning, 
2. causal inference, and 
3. decision quality.

PHT supports causal, evidential, and inter-causal reasoning. BNs, and
it variants (directed acyclic graphs, decision networks), are used for
causal thinking, study design, counterfactuals, deconfounding,
decision analysis, and more. R is the ideal programming language to
learn PHT/PHDS at an introductory level which supports public health
analysts, practitioners, and researchers to bring value, insights, and
causal rigor to the trans-disciplinary table of data science (with
computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, subject matter
experts, etc.).

The core of population health data science is the timely analysis and
synthesis of data using programming and computing power.  Fortunately
for us we have R!  R is a freely available, multi-platform (Linux, Mac
OS, Windows, etc.), versatile, and powerful program for statistical
computing and graphics (http://www.r-project.org). This course will
focus on core basics of organizing, managing, and manipulating
population health data; introduction to R programming; and basic R
graphics, all applied to PHT/PHDS.  Students will complete and present
a project in their field of interest.

PHDS has five analytic domains (Figure
\ref{fig:phds} and Table \ref{tab:phds}):

2& Prediction& early prediction and targeting of interventions\\
3& Explanation & discovery of new causal effects and pathways\\

4& Simulation&modeling for epidemiologic or decision insights\\
5& Optimization$^1$&informing or optimizing decisions, processes, or results\\

## Intended audience

This course is intended for epidemiologists, medical epidemiologists,
data analysts, and demographers that want an introduction to the R
language for population health data science applications. 


## Methods of instruction

Lecture and computer demonstration.  You are welcome to bring your
laptop with R pre-installed.
